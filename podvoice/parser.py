"""Markdown script parser for podvoice.

The expected format is a sequence of speaker blocks, e.g.::

    [Alice | calm]
    Hello and welcome to the show.

    [Bob | excited]
    Aaj hum AI ke baare mein baat karenge.

Speaker name is required, emotion is optional. Text for a block continues
until the next ``[Speaker | emotion]`` header. Blank lines are allowed.
